This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:


* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

### Install dependencies

`yarn install`

### Start development server via

`yarn dev`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
    - it runs application

### `yarn proxy`
    - it runs the proxy server. it's needed to use the API on the local environment

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm coverage`

Launches the test runner in the watch mode with code coverage tool

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### Create local environment config file from dist

`cp .env.dist .env`
